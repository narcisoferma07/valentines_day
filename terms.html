TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR BEING NARCISO’S GIRLFRIEND
Extended Edition – “Healthy but Still Unhinged”
Version 3.9.14

Effective Date: February 14, 2026

Introduction

By reading this document and allowing herself to feel its meaning, Nada willingly enters into this agreement with Narciso, knowing it reflects appreciation, closeness, and honest affection.

SECTION 1: IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES

1.1 “Boyfriend” refers to Narciso, a human being who feels deeply, overthinks often, and is emotionally invested in Nada in a way that is both healthy and slightly ridiculous.

1.2 “Girlfriend” refers to Nada, a remarkable person who is loved for who she is, not who she pretends to be, and who has voluntarily chosen Narciso despite knowing his flaws.

1.3 “The Relationship” refers to a partnership built on affection, communication, trust, humor, and mutual acceptance of weirdness.

SECTION 2: VOLUNTARY ACCEPTANCE

2.1 Nada accepts the role of Narciso’s Girlfriend freely, willingly, and without coercion (except emotional persuasion via sincerity).

2.2 This agreement may be amended at any time through honest conversation, mutual respect, and snacks.

2.3 Both parties acknowledge that love is a choice, not an obligation, and continue choosing each other daily.

SECTION 3: HEALTHY COMMUNICATION

3.1 Both Narciso and Nada agree to communicate openly, even when it feels uncomfortable or awkward.

3.2 Silence is allowed, but avoidance is discouraged.

3.3 Clarifying questions are encouraged instead of assumptions, overthinking, or dramatic internal monologues.

3.4 Both parties agree that saying “I feel” is more productive than saying “You always.”

SECTION 4: ACCEPTANCE & OBSESSION (THE HEALTHY KIND)

4.1 Narciso accepts Nada entirely, including her personality, moods, habits, boundaries, growth, and imperfections.

4.2 Nada accepts Narciso entirely, including his emotions, quirks, overthinking, and moments of unnecessary intensity.

4.3 Obsession is defined as caring deeply, choosing each other intentionally, and wanting closeness without ownership or control.

4.4 Neither party is required to shrink, perform, or change in order to remain loved.

SECTION 5: INDIVIDUALITY CLAUSE

5.1 Nada is allowed to have her own life, interests, friendships, and alone time.

5.2 Narciso is allowed the same.

5.3 Independence is not a threat to the relationship; it is proof of trust.

5.4 Missing each other is permitted and encouraged.

SECTION 6: EMOTIONAL SAFETY

6.1 Both parties agree to create an environment where feelings can be expressed without fear of ridicule, dismissal, or punishment.

6.2 Crying is allowed.

6.3 Needing reassurance is allowed.

6.4 Asking for space does not mean rejection.

6.5 Asking for closeness does not mean weakness.

SECTION 7: AFFECTION & REASSURANCE

7.1 Affection may be physical, verbal, emotional, or all three.

7.2 Reassurance is provided when requested and sometimes before it is requested.

7.3 Narciso agrees to remind Nada that she is wanted, chosen, and appreciated.

7.4 Nada agrees to remind Narciso that he is valued, cared for, and not “too much.”

SECTION 8: CONFLICT RESOLUTION

8.1 Disagreements will happen and are not evidence of failure.

8.2 The goal of conflict is understanding, not winning.

8.3 Raised voices are discouraged; raised empathy is preferred.

8.4 Apologies will be sincere, not defensive.

8.5 Forgiveness is not rushed but is valued.

SECTION 9: BOUNDARIES & CONSENT

9.1 Boundaries are respected immediately, without guilt or pressure.

9.2 Consent applies to physical affection, emotional conversations, and timing.

9.3 Either party may say “not right now” without consequence.

9.4 Love does not override autonomy.

SECTION 10: SUPPORT SYSTEM

10.1 Both parties agree to support each other during difficult days, stressful moments, and personal growth.

10.2 Support does not always mean fixing; sometimes it means listening.

10.3 Successes will be celebrated loudly.

10.4 Failures will be met with patience, not judgment.

SECTION 11: THE SILLY BUT IMPORTANT STUFF

11.1 Hoodies still belong to Nada.

11.2 Narciso will still ask dumb questions during movies.

11.3 Nada will still steal food.

11.4 Laughing together remains mandatory.

11.5 Inside jokes are legally protected emotional property.

SECTION 12: LONG-TERM INTENT

12.1 Jokes about the future are allowed.

12.2 Conversations about the future are welcomed, not feared.

12.3 Neither party is pressured, but both are hopeful.

SECTION 13: FINAL AFFIRMATION

13.1 Nada is loved for exactly who she is right now.

13.2 Narciso is loved for exactly who he is right now.

13.3 Growth is encouraged, but acceptance comes first.

13.4 This relationship is built on choice, care, trust, and genuine affection.
